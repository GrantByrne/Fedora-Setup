```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### Step 2: Make `main.sh` Executable

Make the main script executable:

```bash
chmod +x main.sh
```

### Step 3: Run the Main Script

Run the main script to install all tools and configure your environment:

## Customizing

Feel free to modify any of the individual scripts in the `scripts` directory to suit your specific requirements. You can add additional tools or change configurations based on your needs.

## Troubleshooting

- **Permissions Issues**: If you encounter permission errors, ensure you are running the scripts with proper privileges. You may need to use `sudo` for certain commands.
- **Missing Directories**: The script will automatically create directories like `$HOME/.local/bin` if they do not exist, but ensure your environment supports all intended changes.
